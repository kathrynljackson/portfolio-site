            <p>Never Alone is an application that allows people to check in on each other. The target audience is people caring for someone who is elderly or who is living with a disability, but it could also be utilized for anyone who wants to be able to check in on a friend or family member.</p>
            <p>The aim of the application is to allow a user to quickly check in on how someone is doing, and if they have remembered a task such as taking medications, without being intrusive. Users can set times for check-ins and see if they are accomplished within a set time each day simply by checking their screen at any time.</p>
            <p>This was a group project for the Turing School of Software and Design. We were able to select a project we wished to work on from suggestions put forward by our peers. Since this application seems best suited to be used from a phone or mobile device, we chose to work with React Native and Expo, which were new technologies for everyone on the team.</p>

            <p>The landing page of this app allows the user to choose their role as either the caretaker or the care receiver.</p>
            <img src="img/never-alone/never-alone-1.png" alt="image of application">
            <p>As caretaker, the user has the ability to add, remove, and view tasks that the user should complete throughout that day. The status of each task reflects whether or not that task has been completed by the care receiver.</p>

            <p>As the care receiver, the user can view their tasks for the day and mark them as complete by holding down the button. This mode of communication allows the caretaker to guide the receiver without any loss of autonomy.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Creating an app based on a student idea</li>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li>Most of our projects have very specific learning goals and end product expectations. This assignment required us to set goals on our own, and allowed us to experience the entire process of creating an app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Learning a New Framework</li>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li>While React is part of the Turing curriculum, no one on the team had used ReactNative before. Learning this new technology and using expo was a difficult process.</li>
                        <li>Using a new framework meant that we were unable to utilize the dev tools that we have grown accustomed to.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Increased understanding of asynchronous git workflow
                    </li>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li>Each member of the team lives in a different time zone, so we learned how to be flexible and considerate in terms of scheduling.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Learning more about how styling affects accessibility</li>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li>In order to build an accessible app, we had to consider cognition, physical differences, independence, and motor skills while building out functionality and determining the user experience.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Deployment and Continuous Integration</li>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li>At the beginning of our process, we learned that there would be certain challenges when it came to deploying the app. As a team, we decided to prioritize other goals that could be met realistically given our time frame.</li>
                    </ul>
